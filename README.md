# Marvel Game

This is a two-player game with the theme of Marvel Ultimate War in which each player chooses 3 champions and promotes one of the champions to be a leader. 

* The goal of the game is to defeat all champions of the opponent team. 
* During each turn, a champion has a limited number of action points with which he can move on the board, attack, and cast abilities. On a leader champion's turn, he can also cast a leader ability, which can only be used once throughout the game. 
* Abilities have three types: Damaging Abilities, Healing Abilities, and Crowd Control Abilities. Damaging abilities decrease the targets' health points, while healing abilities increase the targets' health points, whereas crowd control abilities apply a certain effect on targets. 
* There are 10 effects in the game: 5 positive effects (buff) and 5 negative effects (debuff), each with different usages.
